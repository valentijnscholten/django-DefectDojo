### Feature Removal
The `DD_SLA_BUSINESS_DAYS` flag was no longer working and has been removed to avoid confusion.
If it returns, it will probably be part of the SLA Configuration settings in the UI.
There are currently no plans to reimplemnt this feature.
Please follow [11833](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/issues/11833) for updates.

Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.45.0) for the contents of the release.
